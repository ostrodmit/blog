My name is [__Dmitrii. M. Ostrovskii__](http://www.dostrovsky.com/). 
I am a researcher working on various aspects of machine learning, statistics, optimization, and signal processing. I am mostly interested in _theoretical_ aspects thereof, with emphasis on optimality, algorithmic efficiency, adaptivity, and robustness.

The purpose of this blog is to present my research to a broader audience.

[Here](https://ostrodmit.blog/) you could find some posts on the topics I was interested in as a PhD student.

### About me ###
Currently I am a postdoc at INRIA Paris in the group of [Francis Bach](https://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/).
I defended my PhD thesis at the University of Grenoble, supervised by [Anatoli Juditsky](https://ljk.imag.fr/membres/Anatoli.Iouditski/) and [Zaid Harchaoui](http://faculty.washington.edu/zaid/index.html) who is now at the University of Washington.

As an undergraduate, I spent two years at the [Institute for Information Transmission Problems](http://iitp.ru/en/about) in Moscow, working on probabilistic modeling of wireless networks.

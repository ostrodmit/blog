My name is [__Dmitrii. M. Ostrovskii__](https://ostrodmit.github.io/). 
I am a researcher currently based in Paris and working on various aspects of machine learning, statistics, optimization, and signal processing, such as: 
* statistical optimality;
* algorithmic efficiency;
* adaptivity to the unknown structure and parameters;
* robustness.

The purpose of this blog is to present my research to a broader audience.

[Here](https://ostrodmit.blog/) you can find some posts on the topics I was interested in as a PhD student.
